<p class="Muli"> Animal Crossing is a game developed for people of all ages. The Animal Crossing video game series is a series of communication simulation games, exclusively for Nintendo consoles. All games in the series are non-linear, in the sense that they have a somewhat set beginning, but no middle or end. The Player takes the role of a human in a village of animals. The series is non-violent, and rated 'E' for Everyone by the ESRB (3+ by PEGI). The player may take on tasks from villagers, pay off their mortgage, garden, fish, catch bugs, and more. <p class="Muli"> As an open-ended life simulation, the Animal Crossing series does not have a set objective - as such, after an introductory sequence at the beginning of the games, players are free to do as they like. The only "objective" in the game, if any, is to pay off the mortgage placed upon the player's house. But, like most things within the game, this is entirely optional, and does not incur any consequences other than having less space to store items. The Player will eventually become Mayor once they create their town and now being to cover the land with Public Works Projects, being the only two more objectives that have been added.<p class="Muli"> In every town in the Animal Crossing, the village itself is entirely composed of a population of animals (excluding the Player, who is the only human being in the whole series along with other Players). Villagers serve as interactable characters, who are assigned personalities and traits, and this affects the way they communicate with you and among themselves. Villagers are capable of speech (despite being animals), and live in their own domains within the villages. Villagers, in the later games, are also capable of playing games, such as hide and seek, and most often than not, they will usually ask you to perform tasks for them (which ranges from delivering presents to sending a message to another human player), which can incur a reward if executed in the set time. Villagers are also anthropomorphic, and as such, they are able to walk in a humanoid state, and can also wear clothes. Villagers move in and out regularly due to certain factors (eg. because you have exchanged animals with another village over Wi-Fi, or simply because they aren't satisfied with their current life). It is also said that they enjoy receiving letters, and if sent a gift, they will usually send one back.<p class="Muli">Four Animal Crossing games have been released worldwide, one each for the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS, Wii, and the Nintendo 3DS. The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold 23.711 million units worldwide.

      <p>Nintendo still isn't talking about its next big console, codenamed NX, in detail until next year. But new company president Tatsumi Kimishima, who took over for the late Satoru Iwata in September, has revealed that the device won't just be a new take on the Wii like the Wii U was. "I can assure you we're not building the next version of Wii or Wii U," Kimishima explained in an interview with Time. "It's something unique and different. It's something where we have to move away from those platforms in order to make it something that will appeal to our consumer base."<span class="enter"><a href="#" title="enter our contest">Enter</a></span></p>
